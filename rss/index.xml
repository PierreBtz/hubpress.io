<p>The idea of blogging has been making its way in my head for some time now. I&#8217;m already used to blogging on the internal blog of my company, but the audience is really small&#8230;&#8203;and so is the feedback.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By day, I am a UI developer working on multiple stacks going from Swing to Angular 2.0. I am also in charge of the Continuous Integration in my team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am interested in a lot of development topics, especially the subjects of Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery, Testing and Clean Coding.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main idea behind this blog is to share some thoughts about my readings, or the conferences I saw. I would also like to share some of my experiment. As the title suggests, I see this blog as a notepad, for my future self&#8230;&#8203;and for anyone who might have some interest on what I have to say.</p>
