No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://my-site' is therefore not allowed access

As a front-end developer, there are chances you ended up with this message in your console quite a few time.
This article will present a solution I used on both professional and personal developments to be able to deal with the CORS.
It will also come back on other possible solutions I experimented but I was not satisfied with.

## What is CORS anyway?

### Same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a security implemented in browsers that makes sure that a web page A, served from a domain A cannot access ressources from another domain than domain A.
For more details, head to the https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy[w3c wiki].

### CORS

CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing.
They allow a CORS compatible browser (any modern browser) to make cross domain requests to a compatible reverse proxy or a compatible application.

*This is not a security feature!*

In fact, it relaxes a security feature.
As you might have noticed, both ends of the channel need to be compatible: the browser on one side, the server (reverse proxy or application) on the other side.

With the CORS mechanism, the browser automatically adds control headers to the request.
Depending on the type of request it can also make a preflight request.
Request will be successful if the server's answer contains a specific header allowing the domain.

## Issue for the front-end developer

Now, here is the issue: I'm developing a web application that needs to query a RESTful API.
The issue is that this RESTful API is not allowing access to my domain (let's say http://localhost:4200 ).

## Exploration of the first solutions

### On the Application Side

CORS can be configured at the Application level (RESTful API in our case).

If I have a RESTful API developed with SpringBoot I can decide to set the CORS in SpringBoot using the @CrossOrigin annotation or using a Filter for instance.

This method has several issues:

* Purely development stuff lands near production code.
There is a chance, somebody, sometimes, will activate the change in production.
As most of the time, the configuration will be to set a header accepting any domain ("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"), I will let you decide if this is a risk worth taking.

* It implies that you have access to the code of the API.
If it is a public API developped by a third party, then you cannot apply it.

### On the Reverse Proxy Side

A common scenario is that your server is behind a reverse proxy like nginx or haproxy.
You can configure those reverse proxies for CORS.

Again, this method suffers from the same downsides as before.

## The development reverse proxy

Now let's study a purely client solution.
If we fire up a reverse proxy on our client, then we can hide both the web application and the RESTfull API behind it.
The browser will then always see one domain, therefore the same origin policy will be honored and there won't be any CORS issue.

This solution has the following advantages:

* No modification of any code, the reverse proxy is a development tool like npm or maven.
* No need to have access to any server, or to the code of the API running on the server.
* In a lot of case, you are in fact in the same conditions as with your production environment which also has a reverse proxy.

### Hands On!

The solution relies on docker.
It allows to run the reverse proxy as you would any tool.
Of course, you could also use it without docker, but there is more work to make everything work...

You only need two files, a configuration file and a startup script.
We will use nginx, but you can do the same with any reverse proxy.

#### Linux

First file you'll need is the nginx configuration file, nginx.conf:

[source]
----
events { 
    worker_connections 1024; 
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location /api {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/;

            # The following is for the websocket connection of the webpack dev server (https://gist.github.com/simongfxu/ea128160c296f31e41e6)
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }
} 
----

Of course you'll need to adapt, this example is the one I use to develop a web application with a spring boot back end.
The web application is served on port 3000.
The back end is served on port 8080.
What I'm telling nginx is that if the path of the request starts with /api, then the request should be sent to the backend, otherwise, it should be sent to the front end.
The last section of the configuration is a special configuration I had to add so that the webpack dev server works correctly.

Now, let's add a startup script:

[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run --rm --name dev-nginx -p 80:80 --net="host" -v $PWD/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro  nginx:1.11.8-alpine
----

With this script, we are telling docker to boot up a container based on a minimal official nginx image. 
The configuration that nginx should use is bind mounted using the previous configuration file.
The container is running on the same network stack as the host.
Finally we are exposing the port 80.

Once everything is set up, you can start up your front end server, your backend server and finally your reverse proxy.
Then direct your browser to localhost and you should be able to work.

#### OsX

Sadly, the previous configuration won't work on OsX because basically the host mode of Docker is https://forums.docker.com/t/should-docker-run-net-host-work/14215/27[not working like on Linux].

The fastest solution I found was to use my hostname instead of localhost in the nginx.conf:

[source]
----
events { 
    worker_connections 1024; 
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location /api {
            proxy_pass http://hostname:8080/api/;
        }

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://hostname:3000/;

            # The following is for the websocket connection of the webpack dev server (https://gist.github.com/simongfxu/ea128160c296f31e41e6)
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }
} 
----

And the startup script is not using the host network mode:

[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run --rm --name dev-nginx -p 80:80 -v $PWD/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro  nginx:1.11.8-alpine
----

Note that this method also implies that your server can bind to your IP (as you are using localhost but your public interface).

#### What about Windows?

I did not have the opportunity to test either solution on Windows.
I'll gladly edit this article with any feedback on Windows.

That's it for this post.
I hope it will help you configure your development environment.
If you use any other method that you would like to share or discuss, please leave a comment!
