# Docker, yet another starter kit... part 1: Getting Started and Container's lifecycle

:hp-tags: HowTo, Docker

Docker is a major change in the way we develop software.
But it can be a bit challenging for a developer to enter the container world.
This series of articles is an answer to a developer wanting to onboard the Docker train.
It is not designed to be a complete docker training (these already exist), but rather a starter kit to quickly get up to speed.

There is not a fixed number of parts for this series as I am not sure yet how far I want to go (for instance I am not sure yet if I will talk about Docker compose or Docker Swarm).
Of course, do not hesitate to point any mistake or omission.

## Getting Started

### OS

OS does not matter anymore.
Docker is now available natively on Windows 10 (from 1511 November update, Build 10586), OSX and Linux.
I use it without any problem on OSX and a debian at work, and on Windows 10 and a Linux Mint at home.
What I recommand though is to avoid the non native solutions for older OSX and Windows 7/10.
My experience with them was just awful: a lot of issues, of instabilities as well as some strange behaviors.

### Let's go!

Well, this part will be pretty simple.
Go to the https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows[official page], and follow the official tutorial:

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/[Installation]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_two/[Images and Containers]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_three/[Run your first image]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_four/[Build your first image]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_five/[Create your Docker Hub account] this part can be skipped if you have access to a private repository
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_six/[Push and Pull an image] if you are using a private repository, the name of the image becomes $private_repo/docker-whale

In the following, I will assume you have the basic understanding that the tutorial gave you.

## Lifecyle of a container

### Overview

A Docker Container can have multiple states.
Here is a complete list of the different states as well as the associated commands from the official documentation:

image::https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/images/event_state.png[Docker States]

As you can see, there are multiple state possible.

### Main States

The main states are:

* *created*: your container has been created.
This means you have created an instance of an image.
You get to this state by running the command https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/[docker create]

IMPORTANT: Remember what you saw in the tutorial, an image does not have a state and never changes.

* *running*: The container is running which means it has been created (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create/[docker create]) and started (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start/[docker start]).
You can also directly reach this state from an image by running https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[docker run].
* *paused*: A paused container is in a frozen state but its main process *has not been stopped* (the SIGTERM signal was not sent from docker to PID1 process).
The container has not released its ressources (eg memory).
From a running container you reach this state with the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/[docker pause].
It can be unfrozen using the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/unpause/[docker unpause].
* *stopped*: When stopping a container, the SIGTERM signal has been sent from docker to the main process.
After a waiting time (10 seconds by default), the main process will receive a SIGKILL signal.
You can stop a container using https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/[docker stop].
NB: You can also directly send a SIGKILL signal using https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill/[docker kill].
It is probably not a good idea if you wish to restart your container.
You can move from a stopped container to a running container using the docker start command.
