# Docker starter kit part 2: Anatomy of an Image and a Container

In the https://pierrebtz.github.io/2016/11/27/Docker-starter-kit-part-1-Getting-Started-Containers-lifecycle.html[first part] of this blog series on Docker, you had the opportunity to follow a Docker basic tutorial and to have an overview of the lifecycle of a Docker container.

In this post, we will have an overview on what a Docker Image and a Docker Container are made up.

## Anatomy of an image

### Union File Systems

[quote, Docker Official Documentation]
Union file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker uses union file systems to provide the building blocks for containers.

We will see next how those UnionFS are exploited in Docker.

### UnionFS and Docker Images

A Docker image is made of several layers.
Each layer represents a filesystem difference with the layer below it.
The stack of all the layers makes up the filesystem of an image.
Each layer is *read only* and shared between the images (and the containers, as we will see in the next part).

As you may have guessed, all of this means that you need to be very careful when building new image to maximize the reuse of layers.
We will discuss this in details in another blog post of this series.

### Hands On!

Let us take a concrete example.
Let us pull a maven image:

[source,bash]
----
docker pull maven:3.3.9-jdk-8
----

Do not bother with the output of the command yet, we will get back to it later.
Instead, let's now use the history commands that displays all the layers of an image:

[source,bash]
----
docker history maven:3.3.9-jdk-8
----

And the output:

[source]

That is a lot of layers right?
Well, let's try to sort this out.
First let's review the Dockerfile used to build this image, https://github.com/carlossg/docker-maven/blob/33eeccbb0ce15440f5ccebcd87040c6be2bf9e91/jdk-8/Dockerfile[available on github]:

[source, Dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:8-jdk

ARG MAVEN_VERSION=3.3.9
ARG USER_HOME_DIR="/root"

RUN mkdir -p /usr/share/maven /usr/share/maven/ref \
  && curl -fsSL http://apache.osuosl.org/maven/maven-3/$MAVEN_VERSION/binaries/apache-maven-$MAVEN_VERSION-bin.tar.gz \
    | tar -xzC /usr/share/maven --strip-components=1 \
  && ln -s /usr/share/maven/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn

ENV MAVEN_HOME /usr/share/maven
ENV MAVEN_CONFIG "$USER_HOME_DIR/.m2"

COPY mvn-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/mvn-entrypoint.sh
COPY settings-docker.xml /usr/share/maven/ref/

VOLUME "$USER_HOME_DIR/.m2"

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/mvn-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["mvn"]
----

When you build an image, you obviously build the layers from bottom to top.
So if we read the Dockerfile from bottom to top, we should find the list of commands that the history command output:

[source]

It seems correct, up until the `FROM openjdk:8-jdk` command of the Dockerfile.
So, what about those remaining layers?

Let's have a look at the content of the https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/blob/e6e9cf8b21516ba764189916d35be57486203c95/8-jdk/Dockerfile[Dockerfile used to build openjdk:8-jdk] (I removed the comments to the readibility):

----

If you read the Dockerfile from bottom to top, you'll match every command with a layer.
We could continue again with the https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/1845b3f918f69b4c97912b0d4d68a5658458e84f/jessie/scm/Dockerfile[Dockerfile of the next base image (buildpack-deps:jessie-scm)] but I guess you get the point.

[IMPORTANT]
----
A Docker image is a stack of layers.
When you build on top of a base image, you are stacking layers on top of all the layers of the base image.
----

### Base image

At this point, you might wonder which is the mother of all images.
If you continue working up the base images from the previous example, you will get to the https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/1845b3f918f69b4c97912b0d4d68a5658458e84f/jessie/scm/Dockerfile[debian:jessie] image:

[source, Dockerfile]
----
FROM scratch
ADD rootfs.tar.xz /
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
----

The scratch image is a *reserved minimal image* used to signal Docker that you are building an image from scratch.
The next command of your Dockerfile will be the first layer of your container.
The scratch image has a special status in Docker.
You cannot pull it, push it or tag an image with the name.
Building a base image is clearly out of the scope of this blog post.
If you wish to build a base image, you can have a look to https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/baseimages/[the official documentation on base images].

### Back to the output of `docker pull`

Remember, I told you that we would get back to the output of `docker pull maven:3.3.9-jdk-8`.
My output looked like this:

[source]
----

Status: Downloaded newer image for maven:3.3.9-jdk-8
----

The output of the `docker pull` shows you all the *image layers* that the maven:3.3.9-jdk-8 image is made of.
If you compare this output to the output of the `docker history` command, you will notice that we have 11 image layers here for 24 layers in the image.
This is due to the fact that during the build process, docker is able to make optimizations by squashing layers into an image.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The previous statement is right since Docker 1.10.
Before version 1.10, there was a 1:1 ratio between image layers and layers.
----

Of course this does not change anything regarding what you download.
You won't have to download any image if you wish to download the openjdk:8-jdk image for instance:

----

## Anatomy of a container

Now, how does the previous apply to containers?
Well, it is pretty simple actually.
When you create a container, Docker will add a new layer on top of the stack of layers that makes up the image.
Contrary to the image layers, this layer is writable.

If you decide to create another container from the same image, a new writable layer will be created, the rest of the layer stack will be shared.

This diagram from the official documentation pretty much sums it up:

image::https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/sharing-layers.jpg[Layers and Containers]

If you wish to go further in your understanding of containers, particurlarly on the topic of the writing strategies in containers, I suggest https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/[this page] of the official documentation.

That is it for this post, the next one will show you how to manage your data with Docker.
